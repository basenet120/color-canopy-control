# Decisions log

Judgment calls made during the build, newest last. Each says what was decided, why, and what would change it.
Architecture decisions in `docs/context/05` are not relitigated here.

## 2026-09-26

**D1 — Devices are addressed by logical registry id; drivers resolve their own address.**
`bench-kit` is `sim-bench-kit` to the SimDriver and its overlay `metadevice_id` to the AferoDriver. In `bench` mode
the engine runs on the simulator while bench jobs reach the real kit, so one id can't serve both. Real metadevice
ids live only in the ops overlay (never in git). Locks and the rate budget are keyed by driver address.

**D2 — Account connect: JSON API for the CLI, HTML form behind `CONDUCTOR_ACCOUNT_CONNECT=1`.**
07 §3 says the CLI "talks to the running server" and `/ops/accounts` needs the flag. The CLI uses
`POST /api/accounts/login|otp` with the ops Basic credential and a JSON body (not submittable cross-site without a
CORS preflight, which we never grant); it works whenever the gate allows Purpose.ACCOUNT (bench/live). The HTML
form needs the flag, a same-origin check, an attempt limit, `no-store` and `frame-ancestors 'none'`, and turns
itself off after a successful connect. Revisit if Alon wants the flag to gate the CLI too.

**D3 — `sim` + `HUBSPACE_LIVE=1` allows bench jobs only, not account connect.**
The 07 §1 table lists only bench jobs for that row. Connect accounts in `bench` mode (staging) instead.

**D4 — Browser WebSockets live under `/ws/`; the Basic middleware lets them through to ticket auth.**
The existing `/ws` test (no credentials → 1008) still holds because `/ws` isn't under `/ws/`. `/ws/live` closes
with 1008 unless the first message is a valid single-use ticket; foreign Origins are refused before accept.

**D5 — The tester role (and kiosk/vignette) uses one-time enrollment links + an HttpOnly session cookie.**
Same mechanism as 07 §2's kiosk enrollment, so VWBD's crew never gets the ops password. Sessions are revocable
from /ops and survive restarts (`<data>/roles/sessions.json`).

**D6 — `make soak` runs on a virtual-time event loop.**
`VirtualTimeLoop` jumps to the next timer whenever nothing is runnable, so every `asyncio.sleep`/`wait_for`
is free and 8 simulated hours run in seconds with unmodified production code. Only valid without real I/O
(the SimDriver world); the Afero adapter always runs on the real loop.

**D7 — Colour temperature goes on the wire as a string ("2700") and is compared numerically.**
07 §4 cites aioafero's encoding as a string; the fixture reads back an int. `rows.compare` normalizes both.
Bench Gate A/7 settles the device's own encoding.

**D8 — Bench and module-page writes always hold the device's lock.**
07 §1 requires the lock while the page is open; making the executor refuse BENCH writes without a lease means a
bug can't bypass it. ENGINE writes to a locked device resolve LOCKED (nothing sent).

**D9 — This session can't push to GitHub.**
The repo isn't in the cloud session's authorized sources (proxy: "not in this session's authorized repository
set"). Work is committed locally on stacked `claude/*` branches and pushed as soon as access is granted. Alon:
add `basenet120/color-canopy-control` to the session's sources (claude.ai/code → session → Sources / GitHub app).
